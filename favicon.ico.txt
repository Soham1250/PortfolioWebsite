Note: This is a placeholder text file. 

Since .ico files are binary files, we can't directly create them with text content. You'll need to convert the SVG to ICO format.

Here's how to do it:

1. Use an online converter like https://convertio.co/svg-ico/ or https://favicon.io/
2. Upload the favicon.svg file we created
3. Download the converted .ico file
4. Replace this placeholder file with the downloaded .ico file

Alternatively, you can use just the SVG favicon which is supported by all modern browsers.
